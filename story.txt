Title: "Rex, the Paw Hero!"

Once upon a time, there was a brave little dog named Rex. He was the best friend of a boy named Lucas. Rex and Lucas loved playing in the park, running through the grass, and playing fetch all day long. Rex always looked after Lucas, and one day, that would be very important!

One day, while they were playing in the park, a big, mean dog named Max the Villain appeared. He had a bad plan: he wanted to steal Lucas's snack and scare the boy. Max growled and showed his teeth, but Rex wasn’t afraid! He knew he had to protect his friend.

— Stop, Max! — barked Rex bravely. — You won’t scare my friend Lucas!

Max gave a scary laugh and said:

— You think you can stop me, little one? I’m big and strong!

But Rex was smarter. He ran around Max, barking loudly so all the other dogs in the park could hear. Soon, Bella, the fastest dog, and Bob, the big strong dog, came running. Together, they made a circle around Max.

— Give up, Max! — said Rex. — No one messes with my friends here!

Max tried to escape, but he was surrounded. Then, he stopped, lowered his ears, and said:

— Okay, I give up! I was just hungry...

Rex, being a kind little dog, took a cookie that Lucas always carried and gave it to Max.

— Here you go, Max, but you don’t need to be mean to get food. We can be friends and play together!

Max, surprised by Rex’s kindness, accepted the cookie and promised never to be mean again.

And so, Rex not only saved Lucas but also made a new friend. All the dogs in the park played together happily for the rest of the day, with no fear and lots of fun.

The End.
